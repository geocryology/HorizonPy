# added 'delete all' tool

# added panning with middle mouse button

# added functionality for 'overhanging' points:
when digitizing, a right-click will generate a yellow square, this indicates
an overhanging point.  For these points, the azimuth is flipped by 180 degrees
and the horizon will be greater than 90 degrees.

# changed colours: 
overhanging points will be yellow
regular points will be blue 
points 

# simplified point deletion code

already open
